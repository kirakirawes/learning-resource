## ðŸŒ¿ Questions for reflection 

### PART 1. Sense of Place 

Where do your parents/grandparents come from? Do they speak the same language as you do now? 
Which generational family practices and traditions do you do?
How much of you is yourself/or what you value and not a performance of your gender/race/gender/sexuality/class/social expectation/et cetera? 

### PART 2. Doing, Reflecting, Becoming 

How were your practices taught to you?
Who did you read? Where are they from? 
How have your current practices evolved with your sense of place? 
How have your cultural background, cilivised history, and current living environment influenced your practices? 

### PART 3. Finding Your Agency 

What does â€˜designâ€™ mean to you? 
What is power for you? 
What motivates you to participate and take interest in the decolonisation movement? 
How do you embody your values in your practices? What are the challenges you encountered? 

### PART 4. World-building 

What does a just world look like to you?
