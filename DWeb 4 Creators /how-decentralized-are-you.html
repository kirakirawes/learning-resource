Your Netflix algorithm knows you better than your best friend. Your digital life runs smoothly (until it doesn't), and your inbox is full of “security update” emails you didn't ask for.

You live in the warm, fuzzy blanket of Big Tech—everything is synced, shared, backed up, and beautifully branded. But beneath that glossy surface, your data is being mined like it's a rare earth mineral.

You are not necessarily choosing centralization—it is just what was there when you opened the box. That said, awareness is a step toward liberation and you are on the right path. 

    ✨ Vibes: Auto-sync everything, Google knows your shoe size, sponsored by 17 trackers and a cookie banner`;
        } else if (score <= 25) {
          result = `🥸 The Double Agent\n\nYou are the Double Agent, straddling two worlds. You cautiously explore freedom while testing out your digital sea legs.

You've started using encrypted email, maybe dabbled in Mastodon, and finally downloaded a password manager. But there is still a Google Doc open somewhere with your entire life inside. You read the privacy policies (or at least skim them), and you know what a VPN is, but sometimes you just…forget.

You know decentralization is important, but let's be real: you still need to join Zoom meetings and send files via WeTransfer. You are in the tension between values and convenience — and that is okay. This is where most folks are. 

    ✨ Vibes: Slightly paranoid, beautifully inconsistent, Signal for work, Google Docs for everything else; regularly clears cookies “just in case.`;
        } else if (score <= 35) {
          result = `👩🏻‍🎤 The Intentional Rebel\n\nYou are the Intentional Rable — values-driven, actively reducing reliance on Big Tech, digitally literate with just a hint of righteous fire.

You actively choose tools and services that prioritize user agency, decentralization, or open-source principles. You may still depend on centralized systems in specific areas (e.g. payments or work tools)—but you are knowledgeable and discerning.

You make conscious choices about how and where you exist online. You've got your data backed up in triplicate and probably run open-source software just for fun. To you, living fully decentralized is a journey, not a checkbox.

    ✨ Vibes: open-source maximalist, data hygiene enthusiast, kind digital witch with good OPSEC, password manager power user who drinks fair trade tea, lives on open tabs, uses Mastodon and has a Spotify playlist jamming in the background
`;
        } else {
          result = `🦄 The Sovereign Unicorn\n\nYou are the Sovereign Unicon. You are not just a user of the web — you are a co-creator of it.

        You've pieced together a digital ecosystem rooted in autonomy, community, and joyful resistance. You likely run your own services (because you can), participate in governance processes (because you care), and help others demystify the path to digital sovereignty.

You're off the grid but online. Your setup may not be the flashiest — but it is resilient, privacy-respecting, and built on your terms. From running your own mesh network, brewing kombucha, to hosting a blog from a solar-powered Raspberry Pi named “Hermes.” —You don't just decentralize for the sake of it, but because you believe in a more just and equitable internet, where tools serve people, not platforms.

    ✨ Vibes: Per-to-peer pride, full-stack wizard, one-part sysadmin, one-part community weaver; p one foot in the future and one hand in a Linux command line. Your digital life is a commons — and you tend it like a garden.
