# From Paper to Infinity Whiteboard


- For the virtual Mozilla Festival 2021, my team and I designed and ran “Explain Decentralization To Me” — a zine-making workshop structured to meet the needs of a global audience while still preserving the in-person experience.

- Our work in selecting an infinity whiteboard platform and designing the event focused on maximizing user accessibility and maintaining the zine community’s creative, do-it-yourself spirit in an online workshop environment.

- When designing your own digital workshop, always anticipate and center the needs of your audience, account for various skill levels, prepare test runs, incorporate feedback in advance, and be flexible during the event itself. 

With design workshops moving increasingly online, it’s important for designers to familiarize themselves with new tools, approaches, and ways of thinking. When doing so, a common concern tends to arise: How can an online workshop be designed for a global audience while still preserving the value of an in-person experience? In preparing for this past year’s virtual edition of Mozilla Festival, our team met this challenge head on in designing a zine-making workshop for the festival called “Explain Decentralization To Me” (a zine is a format of self-publication that affords creators the utmost freedom of self-expression). The zine community often embraces a spirit of DIY (do-it-yourself) in ways that differ from traditional techniques throughout the production process. So as we planned the workshop, we asked ourselves: How might we foster this creative, DIY spirit in an online workshop?
